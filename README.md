### Context

This dataset provides monthly totals of a US airline passengers (in thousands) from the period of 1949 to 1960. This dataset is taken from an inbuilt dataset of R called AirPassengers.

### Objective

You are a data scientist for this airline and they want to forecast the monthly number of passengers for the next 24 months (i.e for the period of 1961-1962) to balance their manpower hiring and decision on the additional/alteration in the existing and new routes. This forecast will also help the airline to set their dynamic pricing according to the need.
